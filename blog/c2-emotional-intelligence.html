      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

      <h2>Learnings from Search Inside Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is an intelligence that can significantly improve our life potential. While some people through luck og birth or upbringing have naturally high levels of emotional intelligence everyone is able to both acquire and improve on this skill set. There are 5 capabilities central to Emotional Intelligence.
            <ol>
              <li>Self Awareness</li>
              <li>Self Regulation</li>
              <li>Motivation</li>
              <li>Empathy</li>
              <li>Social Skills</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            In training emotional intelligence the first skill to learn is attention. The ability to bring attention to yourself in a calm, stable and perceptive manner is the foundation of emotional intelligence. The way to train this quality of attention is through Mindful Meditation.

      <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
         <p>
           Mindful meditation can be simply described as paying attetion in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment and non judgementally. The ability to do this siginficantly impacts on how we respond and manage our emotions. However in order to be of use this self awareness needs to be directed at our bodies as this is where we experience emotions most strongly. And when we perceive our emotions clearly we can manage and choose our response. So the first step is to apply mindfulness to our body. How? Very simply bring your attention gently to your breath for two minutes each day. If you mind wanders away very just bring it back very gently to your breath. Practicing this very simple skill enable the mind to develop the necessary calmness and clarity to start building high emotional intelligence.

      <h3>My take</h3>
        <p>
          As a part time practioner of transcendental meditation - I see that in large part mindful meditation draws from the practice of trancendental meditation greatly. As a two minute daily practice it is within the reach of most people unlike TM which requires a minimum of one meditation of 20 minutes per day but ideally two. As an individual who experiences high levels of anxiety I know how helpful any type of meditation is in calming the mind. I do think though that there is no sure fire easy path to transformation. That in order to change or train ourselves to be different requires persistence, and hardwork and perhaps it requires a little more dedication than Tang suggests. There is no panacea eg to deep grief or trauma. What meditation can do though is better prepare you to manage it in a life enhancing way as opposed to a life destroying way.
