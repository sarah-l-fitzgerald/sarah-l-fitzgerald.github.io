                  <h5>What is a responsive site?</h5>
                    <p> A responsive site is a website is one that is easy to find your way around and use whether you are looking at it on a mobile phone or ipad or desktop. So if you go from one device to another the website should behave the same in terms of image size, layout and ease of use.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Why is responsiveness important?</h5>
                    <p> Responsivensess is important because of the ever changing world of digital technology. More people today own a mobile phone than those that have access to hot running water. And in wealthier parts of the world many individuals use more than one type of device daily. Designing websites for each type of device is inefficient therefore designing a website so it works well on any device means that the website can keep pace with any change in digital technology so that you and I can still easily access the information we need.
                    </p>
                  <h5>What is mobile first design?</h5>
                    <p>Mobile First Design can most easily be understood as an approach to building something that says start with the most important stuff first and add other things on as space allows. Its a bit like building a house on a budget&#59;the house is the website, the budget is the device. So if you have a small budget to start with you build the essentials as your budget gets bigger you can add more features and &ldquo;nice to haves&rdquo;. Because the smallest screens have the biggest limitations it means it is important to get the essentials of your build right from the beginning.
                    </p>
                  <h5>Frameworks</h5>
                    <p>Frameworks for web development can be thought of in the same way as specialist power tools for building. When you are building a house you can use simple hand tools that will get the job done but will inevitably be a lot slower. Power tools not only speed up the basic process of building but they allow us to more easily customise the house to fit our needs. We don't have to use all the power tools available just those that are going to allow us to build the type of house we need. The benefits of using frameworks are that they speed the process up so that we can spend more time on the more complicated elements of the build. The downside of using frameworks is that perhaps the skill in building a site from scatch is not honed and therefore maybe more prone to mistakes. Perhaps too there is a loss of originality when relying on frameworks to build a website. There maybe some times where simple handtools do a better job then fancy powertools.
                      </p>
                  <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                    <p> A website wireframe is a bit like a back of the envelope house plan. It clearly shows the essential elements of the design but it is not the finished plan and is open to change. From this simple &lqdo;back of the envelope design&rqdo;more detailed plans can be developed before building begins however the orignial design still forms the central point of reference for the build.
                    </p>
                    <p> Wireframes are essential in the development of any design because without them the build can lack cohesion. Without a visual guide of essential elements it would be too easy to design addtional features and content that may not add to the functionality of the website.
                    </p>
                    <p> I found the most difficult elements of my wireframe to implement were the two columns that were to hold the images and the blog post. Fitting the images to the column proved too difficult and in the end I had to change my design in order to progress.
