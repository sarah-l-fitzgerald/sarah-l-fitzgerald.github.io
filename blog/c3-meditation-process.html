                 <h5>How did the process over product concept affect the way you tackled the site design and rebuild?</h5>
                   <p>
                     The process over product concept really helped me focus on achieving this project. By focussing on the steps of the project - I was able to complete it even when I knew from a visual perspective the site did not look how I had wanted. If I hadn't focused on the process then I may have become so mired down I would not have been able to produce anything functional.

                 <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                   <p>
                     Meditation has been part of my life in different ways for the last five years. I have a friend who has been practising for over thirty years and we have had many discussions around what it is and what it can do for wellness. Around three years ago I decided to undertake a transendental meditation course to alleviate severe anxiety. Chapter 2 outlines meditation in an almost identiical way to transendental meditation - the difference beign in the length of time and the process of coming out of the meditation.

                  <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                   <p>
                     My knowledge of meditation has not changed by reading the book, however I was interested in the link to happiness. Initially after reading the declaration that meditation can deliver you happiness I was sceptical but I realised that the happiness that Cheng is speaking of is not the &ldquo popular &rdquo idea of happiness pertpetuated in the media but a deep knowledge of yourself.

                  <h5>Did any of the meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                   <p>The mindfulness meditation closely mirrors the process of transendental meditation with the difference being that a mantra is used in transendental meditation that is particular to each individual. The mantra helps to us to just be in the moment.
