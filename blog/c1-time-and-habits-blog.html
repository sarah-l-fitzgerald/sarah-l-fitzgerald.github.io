      <p> I tried both the pomodoro and timebox techniques and found that the timebox method worked best for me. The pomodoro method left me feeling like I had to rush which I had a higher level of stress meaning that I achieved less.
      </p>
      <p> Of all the time and management resources I forund most iteresting was the video on how small habits can create big change. This resonated with me as typically I will try to make many changes at once and become overwhelmed and demotivated very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>I practise transcendental mediation daily which I find clears my mind and enables me to focus more clearly. It plays a big part in reducing my stress levels and enables me to cope with more difficult challenges.
      </p>
      <p> I will use transcendental meditation in conjunction with the timebox technique as I need the timebox technique to keep me on task- I love to get lost in things.
