      <h1>Reflections</h1>

<p>The Eda experience is akin to a journey of discovery about yourself, your capabilities and your limitations.
</p>
<p>The journey is not an easy one because to complete it you need to let go of your own preconceptions about education, learning and working in a team.
</p>
  <p>My impressions of EDA are that it is exactly what I expected it to be but not at the same time. My experience of learning institutions has been one of sink or swim. So I expected it to be that and you definitely are thrown in the deep end. The difference is that if you want to swim there is someone with you all the way.
  </p>
  <p> My expectations of EDA havent changed: EDA has always been very clear about what and who they are.
  </p>
  <p> I am as my daughter would say "excitanervous"
