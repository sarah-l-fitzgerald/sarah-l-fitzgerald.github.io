      <h1>Things I like in Other Websites</h1>

      <p>The following are some examples of websites I like.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.sarahraven.com/Sarah">Sarah Raven</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/">Zen Garden</a></li>
       <p> There are many elements of the Sarah Raven site that interest me; the nav bar, the use of visual imagery and the coherent layout, the linkages, the list could go on.</p>
       <p> The website from the Zen garden is aesthetically very pleasing and easy to navigate. I like it's simple structure, the clean feel and in this example the background image.</p>

       <h1>HTML, CSS and the DOM

         <p> The Document Object Model is a model is an application programming interface for valid and well formed HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of the documents and the way the document is accessed and manipulated.</p>
         <p> However unless you are a techie this explanation is going to make as much sense as a recipe in Latvian (for a non Latvian readers).</p>
         <p>The best analogy I can find for explaining the DOM is to think of it as the remote control that sits between you and your TV.</p>
         <p>You know that pressing 1 on your remote will turn your TV to channel 1, or that the volume up button will increase the voulme. If you call up the TV schedule you can see what is on next.</p>
         <p>In this way you can understand that the DOM as the remote, you the person as a programming language and the TV as the web browser - the web pages can be thought of as any of the TV menus.</p>
         <p> It doesn't matter what language you speak; as long as someone presses the right button on the remote, the tv will behave in the same way.
         <p> As with the DOM it doesn't matter what language you program with as long as you use the standard properties and methods the results will be the same.</p>
         <P> Just as our remote say for example a sky remote allows us to call up our planner menu- it also allows us to navigate through that menu, we can add a program to our planner or a whole series etc, just as the DOM allows you to interact and change elements of a document.</p>
        <p> How do HTML and CSS relate to the DOM using this analogy. Well think of HTML as the basic structure on a TV menu eg on a sky remote you would find the following menus planner, guide, on demand etc. Once you are inside one of these menus the DOM allows you to interact with different parts of it.</p>
        <p> Finally CSS is what makes the menus look pretty or not and easy to read or not.</p>

        <h1>Boxifying Design</h1>

        <p> Boxifying Design is essentially looking at the different elements within a page as a series of boxes.</p>

        <h1>The Box Model</h1>

        <p> The box model is a set of rules that define how every web page is rendered on the internet. CSS treats each element in your document as a box with a whole lot of different properties that determine where it appears on the page.</p>
