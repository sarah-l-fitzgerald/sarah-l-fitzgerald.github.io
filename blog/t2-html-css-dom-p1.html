      <h1>Things I like in Other Websites</h1>

      <p>The following are some examples of websites I like.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.sarahraven.com/Sarah">Sarah Raven</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/">Zen Garden</a></li>
       <p> There are many elements of the Sarah Raven site that interest me; the nav bar, the use of imagery and the coherent layout.</p>
       <p> The website from the Zen garden is aesthetically very pleasing and easy to navigate. I like it's simple structure, the clean feel and in this example the background image.</p>
