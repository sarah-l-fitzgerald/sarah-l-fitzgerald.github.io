      <h2>What is all the hype about responsive design?</h2>
          <p>
            Today, people use an increasing array of devices to access the web. In order to make your website or pages accessible to as many people as possible it is important that your website is not fixed to a single screen width.
          </p>
          <p>
            In simple terms this means that the website will work the way it was designed to work regardless of the device that you are using.

      <h2>What is grid-based design?</h2>
         <p>
           Grid based design is all about website layout. Grid based design is an idea used in many areas of visual design. The idea is that a grid which is a series of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines can be used to layout the different elements on a webpage which makes it not only more visually appealing but easier to navigate; it creates a sense of visual order.

      <h2>What is Semantic Structure?</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic structure refers to how the structure of a document gives and is necessay for meaning. Just as formating elements such as title pages, headings and paragraphs etc enable a reader to make sense of a book, report or newspaper the same applies in web development. The difference is that in web development these different elements are called tags and the content of a document is marked up with these tags so that the browser and the end user can make sense of it.
